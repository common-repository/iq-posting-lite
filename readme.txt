iQ Posting is the easiest way to get hundreds or even thousands of free visitors to your site every week by setting up Social Media Funnels to your site in less 45 seconds.

Let’s face it, audiences that actually turn into visitors and then customers from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and all of the other social media sites are hard to come by these days.

You want to keep your customers engaged with your profile so you post a link from another site and so what? The social media benefits and maybe the person that clicked on it, but the attention flow is not directly to your site.

The visitor to goes to the other site and big whoop.  Will they remember you 10 seconds later? Maybe… but it does not have to be like that any longer. iQ Posting is a game changer and directs that traffic flow to your site instead.

To get any real exposure, it seems like you have to pay them unless you are a Kardashian or some other Social Media Rockstar right?  Not any more with iQ Posting!

iQ Posting changes all of that! It turns the table on the whole pay to play formula because we use the same technology that Facebook developed!

Think about this for a second. How much content does Facebook actually create?

ZERO!

Because they help share content that other people created. Now guess what? You can no do the exact same thing on your WordPress site or blog.

iQ Posting gives you the very same tools and protocols that FB developed.

iQ Posting gives you the ability to post stories and news from other sites on your site that show up just like when you post a link on Facebook. You no longer have to spend hours and hours creating quality content.

It gets even BETTER! Here is the other part that makes this so brilliant. When you post a link from your site on Social Media from another site, it goes to your site first! You are no longer an information charity for social media!

You can easily improve traffic from to your site from social media by 100%, 200%, even 300%. Plus, you do not have to spend hours every day or paying a lot of money to create content anymore!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I Grab Snippets From All Sites?  =

You can grab snippets that have their act together basically and are using Open Graph.

This is about 90% of all sites. Most you can open using the modal window option and others you have to open in a new window.  Some sites will not work and this is typically because they are not up-to-speed.
